  <h2>Lesson 1: The Basic of Web and HTML</h2>
  <div class="concept">
    <div class="concept-title">WWW(World Wide Web)
    </div>
    <div class="concept-description">
      <p>is an <span class="grayb">information system</span> of interlinked hypertext documents that are accessed via the Internet and built on top of the Domain Name System. It has also commonly become known simply as the Web. Individual document pages on the World Wide Web are called web pages and are accessed with a software application running on the user's computer, commonly called a web browser. Web pages may contain text, images, videos, and other multimedia components, as well as web navigation features consisting of hyperlinks.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="concept">
      <div class="concept-title">HTML(Hypertext Markup Language)
      </div>
      <div class="concept-description">
        <p>is the <span class="grayb">standard markup language</span> used to create web pages. It is written in the form of HTML elements consisting of tags enclosed in angle brackets (like html). HTML tags most commonly come in pairs like and, although some represent empty elements and so are unpaired, for example img. The first tag in such a pair is the start tag, and the second is the end tag (they are also called opening tags and closing tags).</p>

      <div class="concept">
        <div class="concept-title">Tags
        </div>
        <div class="concept-description">
          <p>are the <span class="grayb">hidden keywords</span> within a web page that define how the browser must format and display the content. Most tags must have two parts, an opening and a closing part. You can determine the closing tag because it has a slash.</p>

          </div>
          <div class="concept-description">
            <p>Computers are stupid because they interpret instructions literally. This makes them very unforgiving since a small mistake by a programmer can cause huge problems in a program.</p>

  <h2>Lesson 2: Creating a Structured Document with HTML</h2>
  <div class="concept">
    <div class="concept-title">Developer Tools(Browser)
    </div>
    <div class="concept-description">
      <p>allow web developers to test and debug their code. They are different from website builders and IDEs in that they do not assist in the direct creation of a webpage, rather they are tools used for testing the user facing interface of a website or web application. Web development tools come as browser add-ons or built in features in web browsers. The most popular web browsers today like, Google Chrome, Firefox, Opera, Internet Explorer, and Safari have built in tools to help web developers, and many additional add-ons can be found in their respective plugin download centers. Web development tools allow developers to work with a variety of web technologies, including HTML, CSS, the DOM, JavaScript, and other components that are handled by the web browser. Due to the increasing demand from web browsers to do more popular web browsers have included more features geared for developers.</p>

      <div class="concept-title">The "tree-like" structure of HTML</div>
      <div class="concept-description">
        <p>The "tree-like structure" comes from the fact that HTML elements can have other elements inside of them. You can draw this relationship like a family tree. My mother had multiple children. So did her mother, and so on... In a browser, this structure shows up as a series of nested boxes. There are boxes inside of boxes inside of boxes, and so on...</p>

        <div class="concept-title">The relationship between indented HTML and boxes</div>
        <div class="concept-description">
          <p>When you read an HTML document as text, you see a wave of changing indentations going up and down the left side of the document. The more indented an element is, the more deeply nested it's corresponding "box" is.</p></div>

            <p>A text editor is a type of program <span class="grayb">used for editing plain text files</span>. Text editors are often provided with operating systems and software development packages, and can be used to change configuration files, documentation files and programming language source code.</p>

<h2>Lesson 3: Adding CSS Style and HTML Structure</h2>
  <div class="concept">
    <div class="concept-title">CSS(Cascading StyleSheet)</div>
    <div class="concept-description">
      <p>is a style sheet language <span class="grayb">used for describing the look and formatting of a document</span> written in a markup language. While most often used to change the style of web pages and user interfaces written in HTML and XHTML, the language can be applied to any kind of XML document, including plain XML, SVG and XUL. Along with HTML and JavaScript, CSS is a cornerstone technology used by most websites to create visually engaging webpages, user interfaces for web applications, and user interfaces for many mobile applications.</p></div>
    <div class="concept">
      <div class="concept-title">Understanding CSS</div>
      <div class="concept-description">
        <p>Using CSS styles to format a page separates content from presentation. The content of your page—the HTML code—resides in the HTML file, and the CSS rules defining the presentation of the code reside in another file an external style sheet or in another part of the HTML document usually the head section. Separating content from presentation makes it much easier to maintain the appearance of your site from a central location because you don't need to update every property on every page whenever you want to make a change. Separating content from presentation also results in simpler and cleaner HTML code, which provides shorter browser loading times, and simplifies navigation for people with accessibility issues for example, those using screen readers. CSS gives you great flexibility and control over the exact appearance of your page. With CSS you can control many text properties including specific fonts and font sizes; bold, italics, underlining, and text shadows; text color and background color; link color and link underlining; and much more. By using CSS to control your fonts, you can also ensure a more consistent treatment of your page layout and appearance in multiple browsers.</p></div>

          <div class="summary-description">
            <p>The Benefits of Avoiding Repetition

Repetition is doing the same thing over and over again, as in copying/pasting. The code is more prone to errors if, for instance, the code that was copied/pastied has to be changed. If the change isn't made in every place where it was copied/pasted, errors can arise. Programmers should avoid repetition at all costs, and one way to avoid it is by using Inherit. This is one of the key features in CSS.

With Inheritance properties are applied to a specified element as well as its descendants. Descendant elements inherit text-related properties but not box-related properties. Properties that can be inherited are color, font, letter-spacing, line height, list-style, text-alig, text-indent, text transform, visibility, white-space, and word spacing. Inheritance allows programmers to write less CSS by preventing certain properties from being repeated over and over again.</p></div>

    <p>My name is Ryan Martin Lu and I am 18 years old. I live at Angeles City,Philippines and I just graduated from high school this year and decided to go online course. I just added this few info about me because I'm so much enjoying typing and putting design on this simple web page.<img src="images/me.jpg" alt=" *my picture*"></p>

    <div class="reflection-description">
      <p>I'm very glad that udacity sends feedback on our works/projects. Sending your feedbacks helps me improve more and more. I'm not annoyed that I'm repeating and repeating creating this project. I already submitted 3 projects and none of them met specification. But because of those 3 projects I learned more how to use the codes and what I should do and what I shouldn't do. In lesson 3(Adding CSS and HTML Structure) it took me 4 days before understanding everything about the boxes and other stuff. I repeat and repeat watching the videos, but now, I already got the lesson 3. And I'm happy with it.
